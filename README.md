# Smart TradingView Indicator

A powerful and easy-to-use TradingView indicator that combines multiple technical analysis tools to provide accurate Buy/Sell signals with auto SL/TP levels.

## Main Features
- **Buy/Sell Signals**: Based on Moving Averages (MA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).
- **Auto SL & TP**: Automatically calculates Stop-Loss and Take-Profit levels using ATR (Average True Range) multiplied by a Fibonacci multiplier.
- **Clear Labels**: Displays Entry, Stop-Loss (SL), and Take-Profit (TP) levels directly on the chart for easy tracking.
- **Works on Crypto, Forex & Stocks**: Optimized to work seamlessly across all markets and timeframes.
- **Very Easy to Use**: Simple, effective, and user-friendly, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced traders.

## Trading Logic
- **Buy Signal**: Triggered when:
  - Fast MA crosses above Slow MA
  - RSI is above 50
  - MACD shows a bullish crossover
- **Sell Signal**: Triggered when:
  - Fast MA crosses below Slow MA
  - RSI is below 50
  - MACD shows a bearish crossover
- **SL/TP Levels**: Automatically calculated based on ATR multiplied by the Fibonacci multiplier for dynamic stop-loss and take-profit placement.
